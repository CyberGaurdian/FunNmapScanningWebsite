# FunNmapScanningWebsite
This is a very small website that can be used to run an nmap scan against your network I have it set up on a raspberry pi. Once complete with the scan it will tell you all the devices and the IP's connected to your network then route you to a few links that can help you dig a little deeper into suspect IP's
This works in a few different ways first it has a front end mainly written in html and javascript. When A user navigates to the website thet are prompted to run a scan upon doing so they will have their IP pulled by the website(So no VPN's) when the website does this it also runs a "fast" nmap scan against that host IP. It will then convert the output into a much easier to read format. Once the format is nice and pretty the user will see the devices and IP's on their network. I may expand upon this idea later and make it serve as a pen testing tool, but for now it just can be used for helping someone not so tech savy keep a good eye on their network.
