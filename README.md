# FunNmapScanningWebsite
This is a very small website that can be used to run an nmap scan against your network I have it set up on a raspberry pi. Once complete with the scan it will tell you all the devices and the IP's connected to your network then route you to a few links that can help you dig a little deeper into suspect IP's
This works in a few different ways first it has a front end mainly written in html and javascript. When A user navigates to the website thet are prompted to run a scan upon doing so they will have their IP pulled by the website(So no VPN's) when the website does this it also runs a "fast" nmap scan against that host IP. It will then convert the output into a much easier to read format. Once the format is nice and pretty the user will see the devices and IP's on their network. I may expand upon this idea later and make it serve as a pen testing tool, but for now it just can be used for helping someone not so tech savy keep a good eye on their network.
Also feel free to modify this as much as you want. My end goal is to open this up and then send the sight several IP's then the sight will do a very lightweight scan on those "targets" and kick back results. Could be a pretty useful tool.
